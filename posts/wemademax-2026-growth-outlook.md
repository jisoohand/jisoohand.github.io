# Wemade Max: Why 2026 Could Be a Turning Point for Investors

Wemade Max closed FY2025 with **KRW 148.8 billion in consolidated revenue**, nearly doubling year-over-year (+98.5%). While the company posted an operating loss of KRW 48.7 billion — largely driven by aggressive hiring and development spending — a closer look at the numbers reveals a business that is actively investing in its future rather than shrinking from challenges.

## The Revenue Story: Proven IPs Still Deliver

At the core of Wemade Max's revenue engine is **Night Crows**, which surpassed **KRW 650 billion in cumulative revenue** since its April 2023 launch. The title continues to generate meaningful cash flow across multiple global markets.

Meanwhile, the legacy IP **Silkroad Online** recorded over **30% revenue growth** in 2025, extending a five-year CAGR of approximately 20%. For an IP that has been in operation for over two decades, this level of growth signals strong community engagement and effective live-service management — qualities that translate directly into revenue predictability.

**Lost Sword** and **Akma-dan Dolgyeok!** (which topped both the Korean App Store and Japanese charts) further demonstrate the company's ability to launch and scale titles across different markets and genres.

## Operating Loss in Context: Strategic Investment, Not Structural Weakness

The KRW 48.7 billion operating loss warrants context. Wemade Max has been scaling its workforce and accelerating development pipelines across **five specialized studios** (Mad Engine, Wemade Connect, Wemade Next, One Way Ticket Studio, and Lightcon). This is a deliberate, front-loaded investment cycle — not a sign of deteriorating fundamentals.

Historically, game companies that invest counter-cyclically in content development tend to outperform peers when titles reach commercialization. With multiple high-profile launches slated for 2026–2027, the current loss profile should be evaluated in the context of the company's multi-year roadmap.

## 2026 Pipeline: Diversification Across Genre, Platform, and Geography

What makes the 2026 outlook particularly compelling from an IR perspective is the **breadth and diversification** of the upcoming title pipeline:

| Title | Genre | Target Launch | Studio |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------|
| Night Crows 2 | MMORPG | H2 2026 | Mad Engine |
| Mir 5 | MMORPG | H2 2026 | Wemade Next |
| Noah | Subculture RPG | Q4 2026 | Wemade Connect |
| Hundredth Note | Subculture RPG | Q4 2026 | Wemade Connect |
| Midnight Walkers | Zombie Extraction Shooter | Q3 2026 | One Way Ticket |
| Windrunner (New) | Casual | 2026 | Lightcon |
| Project TAL | AAA Open-World Action RPG | 2027 | Mad Engine |

This is no longer a single-IP story. Wemade Max is evolving into a **multi-studio, multi-genre portfolio company** — a structural shift that, if executed well, reduces title concentration risk and creates multiple potential revenue catalysts.

## The Multi-Studio Model: A Governance Advantage

CEO Son Myeon-seok has emphasized studio autonomy as a core organizational principle. Each of the five studios operates with its own creative direction and development pipeline while sharing group-level infrastructure and publishing capabilities.

From an investor's standpoint, this decentralized model offers two advantages:

1. **Faster iteration** — studios can respond to market trends independently without centralized bottlenecks
2. **Risk distribution** — underperformance by one studio does not paralyze the entire pipeline

## Key Takeaway

Wemade Max is at a familiar inflection point in the gaming industry: a period of elevated investment preceding a wave of new title launches. The FY2025 results demonstrate that existing IPs remain healthy revenue contributors, while the 2026–2027 pipeline presents meaningful upside optionality.

For investors with a medium-term horizon, the current phase represents a window where the market may be pricing in near-term losses while under-appreciating the revenue potential of a diversified, multi-studio launch slate.
