# Five Themes Shaping the Gaming Industry in 2026

The gaming industry is entering 2026 with structural tailwinds that go well beyond any single title or earnings cycle. From the explosive growth of user-generated content platforms to shifting regulatory landscapes and the integration of AI across development pipelines, several macro themes are converging. Here are five key trends worth watching.

## 1. Roblox and the UGC Platform Boom

Roblox has emerged as one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in gaming. By the third quarter of 2025, the platform's daily active users exceeded 150 million — nearly doubling year-over-year — while bookings surged approximately 70% compared to the same period in 2024. Average bookings per daily active user (ABPDAU) remained stable in the $12–13 range, indicating that growth was driven by genuine user expansion rather than monetization gimmicks.

Over the two-year stretch from 3Q 2023 to 3Q 2025, Roblox bookings grew at an average of roughly 11% quarter-over-quarter on a compound basis — more than doubling in cumulative terms.

Two UGC titles exemplify the platform's creative potential:

- **Grow a Garden**, built by a team of just ten developers in roughly three months, peaked at over 2.2 million concurrent players — a platform record at the time of its launch.
- **Steal a Brainrot**, a text-driven viral game that spread through social media, accumulated over 2.5 billion visits and briefly set a new concurrency record at nearly 2.6 million simultaneous players.

A combined community event across both titles pushed Roblox's platform-wide concurrent users to an all-time high of approximately 47 million.

On the creator economy side, Roblox's Developer Exchange (DevEX) program now distributes roughly 22% of platform revenue to developers, with payouts growing over 84% year-over-year. This expanding economic incentive continues to draw increasingly sophisticated creators onto the platform.

## 2. IP Portfolio Building Through M&A

Across the global gaming industry, IP portfolio building through M&A has become a defining strategic theme. The logic is straightforward: owning a diversified IP catalog reduces dependency on any single franchise and opens doors to cross-media licensing.

Several notable transactions in 2024–2025 illustrate the trend:

| Acquirer | Target | Period | Strategic Angle |
|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:----------------|
| Take-Two | Gearbox Entertainment | 2024 | Borderlands franchise consolidation |
| KRAFTON | Tango Gameworks | 2024 | Action IP catalog (Hi-Fi Rush franchise) |
| Scopely | Niantic Games Division | 2025 | Pokemon GO and licensed mega-IP portfolio |
| Tencent | Ubisoft Vantage (stake) | 2025 | Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six access |
| MTG | Plarium | 2024 | RAID: Shadow Legends evergreen IP |

Among Korean publishers, KRAFTON is a standout example, having expanded its IP portfolio significantly over 2024–2025 through a series of strategic acquisitions and partnership deals — growing from a concentrated PUBG-centric catalog into a diversified multi-genre portfolio.

## 3. Platform Fee Structures Under Pressure

The industry's long-standing 30% platform commission is facing challenges from multiple directions. The aftermath of the Epic v. Apple litigation, the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), and regulatory rulings in South Korea have collectively weakened the assumption that a 30% take rate is immovable.

Several companies and platforms have already begun testing alternative structures:

| Entity | Action Taken |
|--------|-------------|
| Epic Games | Built proprietary payment system; directly challenged Apple and Google in court |
| Spotify | Implemented external payment links under EU DMA provisions |
| Korean publishers | Adopted alternative billing options enabled by Korean regulatory framework |
| Apple (small developers) | Reduced commission to 15% for developers earning under $1M annually |

If platform fees were reduced by even 5 to 10 percentage points, mobile-heavy publishers could see meaningful operating margin improvement — particularly those with high mobile revenue concentration.

## 4. AI Integration Across the Development Pipeline

Artificial intelligence has moved beyond the experimental phase in game development. Studios of all sizes are deploying AI tools across the production chain — from procedural content generation and QA testing to AI-driven NPCs capable of dynamic, context-aware interactions with players.

| Studio | Application Area | Notable Implementation |
|:------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------|
| Ubisoft | AI-powered NPCs | "Teammates" prototype using Google Gemini for voice-responsive, personality-driven NPC companions |
| EA | AI-assisted content creation | Stability AI partnership; AI-generated 150 stadiums and 11,000 player likenesses in EA Sports |
| Roblox | AI world generation | "Roblox Cube" generative AI system for creating 3D objects and environments from text prompts |
| Epic Games | AI-integrated engine tools | AI Assistant in Unreal Engine 5.7 and "Persona Device" for AI-driven NPC personalities |
| Square Enix | AI-automated QA | Targeting 70% QA/debugging automation by 2027; AI chatbot embedded in game engine since mid-2024 |

What distinguishes the current wave is the breadth of adoption — AI is no longer confined to a single studio function but is being embedded across art pipelines, QA workflows, NPC behavior, and world-building tools simultaneously. The shift from experimental pilots to production-grade integration marks a structural change in how games are built.

## 5. The PC and Console Resurgence

After years of mobile dominance, the PC and console segments are entering a period of reacceleration. Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2, a deep pipeline of AAA titles, and growing consumer appetite for premium experiences are all contributing to a structural shift.

Global gaming revenue forecasts by platform tell the story:

Mobile's share of the overall market is projected to edge down from approximately 55% in 2022 to around 53–54% by 2028, while console's share grows modestly on the back of a stronger hardware cycle and premium content slate.

The console CAGR acceleration — from roughly 1% over 2022–2025 to nearly 5% over 2025–2028 — is largely driven by:

- **Nintendo Switch 2**: Expected to revitalize the hybrid console category with backward compatibility and a modernized hardware specification
- **AAA pipeline depth**: Major publishers stacking release schedules with tentpole first-party and third-party titles
- **Premium gaming demand**: Growing appetite for high-fidelity, narrative-driven experiences that monetize through upfront purchases and DLC rather than free-to-play mechanics
