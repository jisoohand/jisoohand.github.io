# Five Themes Shaping the Gaming Industry in 2026

The gaming industry is entering 2026 with structural tailwinds that go well beyond any single title or earnings cycle. From the explosive growth of user-generated content platforms to shifting regulatory landscapes and the integration of AI across development pipelines, several macro themes are converging. Here are five key trends worth watching.

## 1. Roblox and the UGC Platform Boom

Roblox has emerged as one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in gaming. By the third quarter of 2025, the platform's daily active users exceeded 150 million — nearly doubling year-over-year — while bookings surged approximately 70% compared to the same period in 2024. Average bookings per daily active user (ABPDAU) remained stable in the $12–13 range, indicating that growth was driven by genuine user expansion rather than monetization gimmicks.

What stands out is the acceleration of bookings growth after a period of more moderate gains:

| Period | Bookings YoY Growth | Context |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 3Q 2023 | ~20% | Post-pandemic normalization |
| 1Q 2024 | ~22% | Steady baseline pace |
| 3Q 2024 | ~34% | Acceleration begins |
| 1Q 2025 | ~31% | Sustained momentum |
| 3Q 2025 | ~70% | Breakout quarter |

Two UGC titles exemplify the platform's creative potential:

- **Grow a Garden**, built by a team of just ten developers in roughly three months, peaked at over 2.2 million concurrent players — a platform record at the time of its launch.
- **Steal a Brainrot**, a text-driven viral game that spread through social media, accumulated over 2.5 billion visits and briefly set a new concurrency record at nearly 2.6 million simultaneous players.

A combined community event across both titles pushed Roblox's platform-wide concurrent users to an all-time high of approximately 47 million.

On the creator economy side, Roblox's Developer Exchange (DevEX) program now distributes roughly 22% of platform revenue to developers, with payouts growing over 84% year-over-year. This expanding economic incentive continues to draw increasingly sophisticated creators onto the platform.

## 2. IP Portfolio Building Through M&A

Korean game publishers are increasingly pursuing acquisitions not just for studio capacity, but specifically to accumulate intellectual property. The strategic logic is straightforward: owning a diversified IP portfolio reduces dependency on any single franchise and opens doors to cross-media licensing opportunities.

Several notable transactions in 2024–2025 illustrate the trend:

| Acquirer | Target | Period | Strategic Angle |
|----------|--------|--------|----------------|
| Shift Up | ADK Emotions | 2024 | Animation and IP pipeline expansion |
| KRAFTON | Tango Gameworks | 2024 | Action IP catalog (Hi-Fi Rush franchise) |
| Nexon | Atlus (stake) | 2025 | RPG IP access (Persona, Shin Megami Tensei) |
| Hybe IM | Undisclosed studio | 2025 | Entertainment IP cross-pollination |
| Netmarble | Undisclosed studio | 2025 | IP diversification across genres |

This mirrors what Western mega-publishers like Tencent, Microsoft, and EA have pursued over the past decade. The difference is that Korean companies — historically mobile-first — are now building multi-platform IP libraries that can support franchising across games, animation, and merchandise.

KRAFTON is a standout example, having expanded its IP portfolio significantly over 2024–2025 through a series of strategic acquisitions and partnership deals, growing from a concentrated PUBG-centric catalog into a diversified multi-genre portfolio.

## 3. Platform Fee Structures Under Pressure

The industry's long-standing 30% platform commission is facing challenges from multiple directions. The aftermath of the Epic v. Apple litigation, the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), and regulatory rulings in South Korea have collectively weakened the assumption that a 30% take rate is immovable.

Several companies and platforms have already begun testing alternative structures:

| Entity | Action Taken |
|--------|-------------|
| Epic Games | Built proprietary payment system; directly challenged Apple and Google in court |
| Spotify | Implemented external payment links under EU DMA provisions |
| Korean publishers | Adopted alternative billing options enabled by Korean regulatory framework |
| Apple (small developers) | Reduced commission to 15% for developers earning under $1M annually |

The financial implications are meaningful. If platform fees were reduced by 5 to 10 percentage points, operating profit margins for mobile-heavy game companies could see material improvement:

| Company Profile | Current OPM (est.) | OPM with 5pp Fee Cut | OPM with 10pp Fee Cut |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Mobile-heavy publisher (e.g., Netmarble, Com2uS) | ~15–19% | ~19–23% | ~23–27% |
| Diversified publisher (e.g., KRAFTON, Pearl Abyss) | ~30–35% | ~33–37% | ~35–42% |

Companies with higher mobile revenue concentration stand to benefit the most, while studios with diversified PC and console revenue streams would see proportionally smaller but still positive margin effects.

## 4. AI Integration Across the Development Pipeline

Artificial intelligence has moved beyond the experimental phase in game development. Studios of all sizes are deploying AI tools across the production chain — from procedural content generation and QA testing to AI-driven NPCs capable of dynamic, context-aware interactions with players.

| Studio | Application Area | Notable Implementation |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| KRAFTON | Full-stack AI integration | Operating 150+ internal AI models; LLM-assisted tools across coding, art, and testing |
| Nexon | AI NPCs | Planning AI-driven NPC deployment in MapleStory ecosystem |
| Netmarble | Nvidia ACE integration | Building AI-powered character interaction tools using Nvidia's Avatar Cloud Engine |
| Hybe IM | Content automation | AI-assisted generation pipeline for live-service game content |
| Line Games | Development productivity | Integrating AI into core development workflows |

Chinese studios are arguably the furthest ahead in adopting AI at scale, with several major publishers reporting that AI tools are now embedded into daily workflows for art asset creation, dialogue writing, and automated testing.

Among Korean developers, KRAFTON stands out for the sheer scale of its investment — operating over 150 AI models internally and building proprietary tools that span code generation, concept art, game balancing, and NPC behavior systems. The company has positioned AI not as a bolt-on experiment but as a core infrastructure layer.

## 5. The PC and Console Resurgence

After years of mobile dominance, the PC and console segments are entering a period of reacceleration. Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2, a deep pipeline of AAA titles, and growing consumer appetite for premium experiences are all contributing to a structural shift.

Global gaming revenue forecasts by platform tell the story:

| Platform | 2022 ($B) | 2025F ($B) | 2028F ($B) | CAGR '22–'25 | CAGR '25–'28 |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Console | ~37 | ~38 | ~44 | ~1.0% | ~4.7% |
| Mobile | ~101 | ~109 | ~118 | ~2.7% | ~2.8% |
| PC | ~46 | ~51 | ~57 | ~3.5% | ~3.7% |
| **Total** | **~184** | **~198** | **~219** | **~2.5%** | **~3.4%** |

Mobile's share of the overall market is projected to edge down from approximately 55% in 2022 to around 53–54% by 2028, while console's share grows modestly on the back of a stronger hardware cycle and premium content slate.

The console CAGR acceleration — from roughly 1% over 2022–2025 to nearly 5% over 2025–2028 — is largely driven by:

- **Nintendo Switch 2**: Expected to revitalize the hybrid console category with backward compatibility and a modernized hardware specification
- **AAA pipeline depth**: Major publishers stacking release schedules with tentpole first-party and third-party titles
- **Premium gaming demand**: Growing appetite for high-fidelity, narrative-driven experiences that monetize through upfront purchases and DLC rather than free-to-play mechanics
